5 RECOMMENDED SONGS

The project was made in order to present an algorithm that easily recommends 5 songs that are similar to the one chosen by user.
An algorithm selects the most similar songs from the dataset provided by the spotify platform. 
Calculations are basen on parameters such as tempo, energy and danceability of the track.
I used pandas for working with dataset, creating dummy variables, appending new columns. 
Recommendation system was made by calculating the distance between choosen song and rest songs from the dataset. For the estimation I used scipy.
